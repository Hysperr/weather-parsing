    Write a method that reads both data sets and finds the day in which the conditions

    your choice of measurements.

    AA=DAILYMaximumDryBulbTemp
    AB=DAILYMinimumDryBulbTemp
    AC=DAILYAverageDryBulbTemp

    Comparing AA, AB, AC values as they provide a general summary of the day's
    climate in numerical representation, and each csv file has all of these
    particular fields (for simplicity's sake). The key is to sort the data
    on the numerical fields such that similar fields from each file from can
    be compared adjacently.

    Makes runtime a feasible ~1.5 seconds O(n + nlogn) instead of O(n^2) which,
    on massive data sets like this could take hours to run. The numerical fields
    are vectorized then compared by taking taking the Euclidean distance between
    adjacent vectors. In the code I find the norm of the difference between the
    vectors to get this distance. Then the distance is normalized with respect to
    the norm of one the the original vectors. This function can be easily and efficiently
    expanded to increase accuracy as long as new criteria is represented numerically.
